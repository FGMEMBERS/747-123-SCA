The real aircraft
=================
The generic passenger configuration 200B (A), with 10 portholes at upper deck,
and 3 cargo doors on the right side.

The texture is N638US (B), a 251B powered by the JT9D-7R4G2 (C);
on upper deck, the left exit door and 6 portholes are obstructed.

JT9D-7RG4G2 has a nacelle with hole; inside turbofan, air is bypassed around the shaft,
providing a large part of thrust.


Model
=====
The proportions of (A) are respected.

Fuselage is shaped by a cylinder and the upper deck :
these 2 meshes though merged are still kept distinct.

This model might also be used as 747-100 (same dimensions and portholes ?).


Cockpit
-------
The engineer panel is not smoothed (solid).


VRP
---
The model is aligned vertically along the nose axis, but is still centered
horizontally on the center of gravity :
- that is more handy with the Blender grid. 
- the alignment of VRP to the nose tip is finished by XML (horizontal offset).


Texturing
---------
Wing colors by N627US (D).

Wing : mirror the right wing to the left wing.
Rudder : map at once the logo on both sides.

Engine : the rose is for very hot parts.

Floor color by 9G-MKS (E).


TO DO
=====
- aft shape of JT9D-7RG4G2 engine ?

TO DO livery
------------
- KLM-NW logo, on the right side.
- release the Metapost file.


Known problems
==============
- transparency ordering of cockpit glasses.
- the a of "nwa".
- the portholes should have a roundness.
- the livery is difficult to repaint (not a skin).
